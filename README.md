# Spatial Types Library

PHP library providing spatial types and their geometric and geographic classes.

If you want to persist spatial data in a database,
you should use the [longitude-one/doctrine2-spatial](https://github.com/longitude-one/doctrine2-spatial) package.

## Installation

```bash
composer require longitude-one/spatial-types
```

## Usage

```php
use LongitudeOne\SpatialTypes\Types\Dimension2\Geometry\LineString;
use LongitudeOne\SpatialTypes\Types\Dimension2\Geometry\Point;

$point = new Point(1, 2);
echo $point->getX(); // 1
echo $point->getY(); // 2

$lineString = new LineString([
    new Point(1, 2, 4326),
    new Point(3, 4, 4326),
    new Point(5, 6, 4326),
], 4326);
$lineString->getSrid(); // 4326
```

mutability rules, see [Instantiable spatial types](docs/instantiable-spatial-types.md).

## Type class hierarchy

The following tree describes class inheritance in `Types`, rather than the
file layout. Intermediate abstract classes are hidden; only
`AbstractSpatialType` and instantiable classes are shown. `{Dimension2,
Dimension3m, Dimension3z, Dimension4zm}` represents one branch for each listed
coordinate dimension and `{Geometry, Geography}` one concrete class for each
spatial model. For the complete hierarchy, including intermediate abstract
classes, see [Type class hierarchy](docs/type-class-hierarchy.md).

```text
AbstractSpatialType
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\{Geometry,Geography}\Point
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\{Geometry,Geography}\LineString
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\{Geometry,Geography}\Polygon
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\{Geometry,Geography}\MultiPoint
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\{Geometry,Geography}\MultiLineString
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\{Geometry,Geography}\MultiPolygon
├── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\Geometry\GeometryCollection
└── Dimension{2,3m,3z,4zm}\Geography\GeographyCollection
```

### Types not yet available

`CircularString`, `CompoundCurve`, `CurvePolygon`, `MultiCurve`,
`MultiSurface`, `PolyhedralSurface`, `TIN`, and `Triangle` do not yet have
instantiable classes. See [Instantiable spatial types](docs/instantiable-spatial-types.md)
for the complete coverage matrix.

## Immutability

Spatial values are immutable and safe to share: their coordinates, SRID, and
aggregate membership are set at construction time and never changed through
the public API. Use `withCoordinates()` with an immutable `Value\Coordinates`
value to represent another location, or `withSpatialReference()` to associate
the same coordinates with another declared reference. Both return new objects.

`LineString` and `Polygon` also provide
`withArrayOfCoordinates()` to create a new instance with replacement
coordinates. This preserves their family, dimension, and SRID without changing
the source object.

This prevents a value shared by other aggregates from silently changing them.
See [Immutability](docs/immutability.md) for the rationale, examples, and the
complete contract.

## Spatial reference system (SRS)

Every spatial object has a `Reference\SpatialReference`. Its legacy integer
projection remains available through `getSrid()`, while `getSpatialReference()`
preserves the optional authority (for example `EPSG:4326`). Constructors and
factories accept either a legacy integer or a `SpatialReference` instance.

All members of an aggregate must have exactly the same spatial reference
system, including the unnamed reference represented by identifier `0`. It is
not a wildcard. Use `withSpatialReference()` (or the legacy `withSrid()`) only
to relabel coordinates; neither method performs a reprojection.

See [Spatial reference systems](docs/spatial-reference-systems.md) for the
strict aggregate rule, its ISO/IEC 13249-3 basis, and the distinction between
declaring a reference and transforming coordinates.
